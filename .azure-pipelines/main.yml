# We run the test suite on commits to master so codecov gets coverage data
# about the master branch and can use it to track coverage changes.

  # We set this here to avoid coverage data being uploaded from things like our
  # nightly pipeline. This is done because codecov (helpfully) keeps track of
  # the number of coverage uploads for a commit and displays a warning when
  # comparing two commits with an unequal number of uploads. Only uploading
  # coverage here should keep the number of uploads it sees consistent.
