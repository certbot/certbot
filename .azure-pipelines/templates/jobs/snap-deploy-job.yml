# As (somewhat) described at
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/templates?view=azure-devops#context,
# each template only has access to the parameters passed into it. To help make
# use of this design, we define snapReleaseChannel without a default value
# which requires the user of this template to define it as described at
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema/parameters-name?view=azure-pipelines#remarks.
# This makes the user of this template be explicit while allowing them to
# define their own parameters with defaults that make sense for that context.
parameters:
- name: snapReleaseChannel
  type: string
  values:
  - edge
  - beta
  - candidate

jobs:
  # This job relies on credentials used to publish the Certbot snaps. This
  # credential file was created by running:
  #
  #   snapcraft logout
  #   snapcraft export-login --channels=candidate,beta,edge snapcraft.cfg
  #     (provide the shared snapcraft credentials when prompted)
  #
  # Then the file was added as a secure file in Azure pipelines
  # with the name snapcraft.cfg by following the instructions at
  # https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/secure-files?view=azure-devops
  # including authorizing the file for use in the "nightly" and "release"
  # pipelines as described at
  # https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/secure-files?view=azure-devops#q-how-do-i-authorize-a-secure-file-for-use-in-a-specific-pipeline.
  #
  # This file has a maximum lifetime of one year and the current file will
  # expire on 2023-09-06. The file will need to be updated before then to
  # prevent automated deploys from breaking.
  #
  # Revoking these credentials can be done by changing the password of the
  # account used to generate the credentials. See
  # https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/revoking-exported-credentials/19031 for
  # more info.
