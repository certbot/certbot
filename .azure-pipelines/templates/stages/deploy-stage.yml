      # This job relies on credentials used to publish the Certbot snaps. This
      # credential file was created by running:
      #
      #   snapcraft logout
      #   snapcraft login (provide the shared snapcraft credentials when prompted)
      #   snapcraft export-login --channels=beta,edge snapcraft.cfg
      #
      # Then the file was added as a secure file in Azure pipelines
      # with the name snapcraft.cfg by following the instructions at
      # https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/secure-files?view=azure-devops
      # including authorizing the file in all pipelines as described at
      # https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/secure-files?view=azure-devops#how-do-i-authorize-a-secure-file-for-use-in-all-pipelines.

      # This file has a maximum lifetime of one year and the current
      # file will expire on 2021-07-28 which is also tracked by
      # https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/7931. The file will
      # need to be updated before then to prevent automated deploys
      # from breaking.
      #
      # Revoking these credentials can be done by changing the password of the
      # account used to generate the credentials. See
