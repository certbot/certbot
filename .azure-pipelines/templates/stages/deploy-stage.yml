      # This credential has a maximum lifetime of 1 year and the current
      # credential will expire on 6/25/2021. The content of snapcraft.cfg
      # will need to be updated to use a new credential before then to
      # prevent automated deploys from breaking. Remembering to do this is
      # also tracked by https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/7931.
