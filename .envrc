# This file is just a nicety for developers who use direnv. When you cd under
# the Certbot repo, Certbot's virtual environment will be automatically
# activated and then deactivated when you cd elsewhere. Developers have to have
# direnv set up and run `direnv allow` to allow this file to execute on their
# system. You can find more information at https://direnv.net/.

# direnv doesn't support modifying PS1 so we unset it to squelch the error
# it'll otherwise print about this being done in the activate script. See
# https://github.com/direnv/direnv/wiki/PS1. If you would like your shell
# prompt to change like it normally does, see
# https://github.com/direnv/direnv/wiki/Python#restoring-the-ps1.
