        I ran this command and it produced this output. Example:
        ```
        $ sudo certbot certonly -d adfsfasdf.asdfasdf --staging
        Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
        Plugins selected: Authenticator nginx, Installer nginx
        Requesting a certificate for example.com
        An unexpected error occurred:
        Invalid identifiers requested :: Cannot issue for "adfsfasdf.asdfasdf": Domain name does not end with a valid public suffix (TLD)
        Ask for help or search for solutions at https://community.letsencrypt.org. See the logfile /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log or re-run Certbot with -v for more details.
