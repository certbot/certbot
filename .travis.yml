# To mimic README.md installation and hacking instructions as much as
# possible, this config file instructs Travis CI to create a build
# environment for each supported Python version, and then for each of
# those it runs tox with two environments: lint and pyXX corresponding
# to the currently used Travis CI build Python version.
