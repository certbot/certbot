This file serves as an entry point for GitHub's Contributing
Guidelines [1] only.

GitHub doesn't render rST very well, especially in respect to internal
hyperlink targets and cross-references [2]. People also tend to
confuse rST and Markdown syntax. Therefore, instead of keeping the
contents here (and including from rST documentation under doc/), link
to the Sphinx generated docs is provided below.
