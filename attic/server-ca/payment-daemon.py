# Wait for news about payments received for sesssions and
# then mark the sessions to show that that payment was received.

# The reason that this is separate from payment.py (which
# simulates actually processing a credit card payment) is
# to make the security analysis simpler and cleaner and
# reduce attack surface.  The idea is that payment.py decides
# whether someone has paid, but NOT whether the certificate
# has been granted.  This daemon decides whether the
# certificate should be granted, but NOT whether someone has
# paid.  Thus, payment.py does not need, or exercise, the
# power to change session status directly.

# This preserves the rule that session status is only ever
# advanced by the appropriate daemon (though a session may
# be killed by any part of the system that identifies a
# fatal problem or protocol violation).

# This daemon uses a different scheduling model from the
# testchallenge daemon so ONLY ONE COPY OF THIS DAEMON SHOULD
# BE RUN AT ONCE.  Since this daemon takes a minimal, discrete
# action in response to a pubsub message, there should never be
# a significant backlog associated with this daemon.
