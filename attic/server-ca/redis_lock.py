# This is an attempt at implementing the locking algorithm described at
#                http://redis.io/commands/setnx
# as a Python lock object that can be used with the Python "with"
# statement.  To use:
#
# lock = redis_lock(redis_instance, "name")
# with lock:
#      # do stuff guarded by the lock
#
# Only one process will be able to enter the block at a time for a
# given Redis instance and name, as long as the most recent process
# to enter the block did so less than timeout seconds ago.  All
# processes attempting to acquire the lock will poll to see if it
# is released or expires.  If the algorithm is correct and correctly
# implemented, only one process succeds in clearing and acquiring a
# particular expired lock, even "when multiple clients detected an
# expired lock and are trying to release it".
#
# The optional one_shot parameter causes the attempt to acquire the
# lock to instead raise a KeyError exception if someone else is already
# holding a valid lock.  This is used in situations where a process
# doesn't insist on doing the actions guarded by the lock.
