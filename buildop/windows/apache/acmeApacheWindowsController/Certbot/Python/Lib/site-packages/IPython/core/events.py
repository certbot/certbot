"""Infrastructure for registering and firing callbacks on application events.

Unlike :mod:`IPython.core.hooks`, which lets end users set single functions to
be called at specific times, or a collection of alternative methods to try,
callbacks are designed to be used by extension authors. A number of callbacks
can be registered for the same event without needing to be aware of one another.

The functions defined in this module are no-ops indicating the names of available
events and the arguments which will be passed to them.

.. note::

   This API is experimental in IPython 2.0, and may be revised in future versions.
