Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that can be used in IDEs/editors.
Jedi has a focus on autocompletion and goto functionality. Jedi is fast and is
very well tested. It understands Python and stubs on a deep level.

Jedi has support for different goto functions. It's possible to search for
references and list names in a Python file to get information about them.

Jedi uses a very simple API to connect with IDE's. There's a reference
implementation as a `VIM-Plugin <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim>`_,
which uses Jedi's autocompletion.  We encourage you to use Jedi in your IDEs.
Autocompletion in your REPL is also possible, IPython uses it natively and for
the CPython REPL you have to install it.

Jedi can currently be used with the following editors/projects:

- Vim (jedi-vim_, YouCompleteMe_, deoplete-jedi_, completor.vim_)
- Emacs (Jedi.el_, company-mode_, elpy_, anaconda-mode_, ycmd_)
- Sublime Text (SublimeJEDI_ [ST2 + ST3], anaconda_ [only ST3])
- TextMate_ (Not sure if it's actually working)
- Kate_ version 4.13+ supports it natively, you have to enable it, though. [`proof
  <https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/applications/kate/repository/show?rev=KDE%2F4.13>`_]
- Atom_ (autocomplete-python-jedi_)
- `GNOME Builder`_ (with support for GObject Introspection)
- `Visual Studio Code`_ (via `Python Extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python>`_)
- Gedit (gedi_)
- wdb_ - Web Debugger
- `Eric IDE`_ (Available as a plugin)
- `IPython 6.0.0+ <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version6.html>`_

and many more!

There is also support for goto and renaming.

Get the latest version from `github <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi>`_
(master branch should always be kind of stable/working).

Docs are available at `https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_. Pull requests with documentation
enhancements and/or fixes are awesome and most welcome. Jedi uses `semantic
versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.

If you want to stay up-to-date (News / RFCs), please subscribe to this `github
thread <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/1063>`_.:



Installation
============

    pip install jedi

Note: This just installs the Jedi library, not the editor plugins. For
information about how to make it work with your editor, refer to the
corresponding documentation.

You don't want to use ``pip``? Please refer to the `manual
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html>`_.


Feature Support and Caveats
===========================

Jedi really understands your Python code. For a comprehensive list what Jedi
understands, see: `Features
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/features.html>`_. A list of
caveats can be found on the same page.

You can run Jedi on CPython 2.7 or 3.4+ but it should also
understand/parse code older than those versions. Additionally you should be able
to use `Virtualenvs <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/api.html#environments>`_
very well.

Tips on how to use Jedi efficiently can be found `here
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/features.html#recipes>`_.

API
---

You can find the documentation for the `API here <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/api.html>`_.


Autocompletion / Goto / Pydoc
-----------------------------

Please check the API for a good explanation. There are the following commands:

- ``jedi.Script.goto``
- ``jedi.Script.complete``
- ``jedi.Script.get_references``

The returned objects are very powerful and really all you might need.


Autocompletion in your REPL (IPython, etc.)
-------------------------------------------

Starting with IPython `6.0.0` Jedi is a dependency of IPython. Autocompletion
in IPython is therefore possible without additional configuration.

It's possible to have Jedi autocompletion in REPL modes - `example video <https://vimeo.com/122332037>`_.
This means that in Python you can enable tab completion in a `REPL
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/usage.html#tab-completion-in-the-python-shell>`_.


Static Analysis
------------------------

To do all forms of static analysis, please try to use
``jedi.Script(...).get_names``. It will return a list of names that you can use
to infer types and so on.


Refactoring
-----------

Jedi's parser would support refactoring, but there's no API to use it right
now.  If you're interested in helping out here, let me know. With the latest
parser changes, it should be very easy to actually make it work.


Development
===========

There's a pretty good and extensive `development documentation
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/development.html>`_.


Testing
=======

The test suite depends on ``tox`` and ``pytest``::

    pip install tox pytest

To run the tests for all supported Python versions::

    tox

If you want to test only a specific Python version (e.g. Python 2.7), it's as
easy as ::

    tox -e py27

Tests are also run automatically on `Travis CI
<https://travis-ci.org/davidhalter/jedi/>`_.

For more detailed information visit the `testing documentation
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/testing.html>`_.

Changelog
---------

0.16.0 (2020-01-26)
+++++++++++++++++++

- **Added** ``Script.get_context`` to get information where you currently are.
- Completions/type inference of **Pytest fixtures**.
- Tensorflow, Numpy and Pandas completions should now be about **4-10x faster**
  after the first time they are used.
- Dict key completions are working now. e.g. ``d = {1000: 3}; d[10`` will
  expand to ``1000``.
- Completion for "proxies" works now. These are classes that have a
  ``__getattr__(self, name)`` method that does a ``return getattr(x, name)``.
  after loading them initially.
- Goto on a function/attribute in a class now goes to the definition in its
  super class.
- Big **Script API Changes**:
    - The line and column parameters of ``jedi.Script`` are now deprecated
    - ``completions`` deprecated, use ``complete`` instead
    - ``goto_assignments`` deprecated, use ``goto`` instead
    - ``goto_definitions`` deprecated, use ``infer`` instead
    - ``call_signatures`` deprecated, use ``get_signatures`` instead
    - ``usages`` deprecated, use ``get_references`` instead
    - ``jedi.names`` deprecated, use ``jedi.Script(...).get_names()``
- ``BaseDefinition.goto_assignments`` renamed to ``BaseDefinition.goto``
- Add follow_imports to ``Definition.goto``. Now its signature matches
  ``Script.goto``.
- **Python 2 support deprecated**. For this release it is best effort. Python 2
  has reached the end of its life and now it's just about a smooth transition.
  Bugs for Python 2 will not be fixed anymore and a third of the tests are
  already skipped.
- Removed ``settings.no_completion_duplicates``. It wasn't tested and nobody
  was probably using it anyway.
- Removed ``settings.use_filesystem_cache`` and
  ``settings.additional_dynamic_modules``, they have no usage anymore. Pretty
  much nobody was probably using them.

0.15.2 (2019-12-20)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Signatures are now detected a lot better
- Add fuzzy completions with ``Script(...).completions(fuzzy=True)``
- Files bigger than one MB (about 20kLOC) get cropped to avoid getting
  stuck completely.
- Many small Bugfixes
- A big refactoring around contexts/values

0.15.1 (2019-08-13)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Small bugfix and removal of a print statement

0.15.0 (2019-08-11)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Added file path completions, there's a **new** ``Completion.type`` now:
  ``path``. Example: ``'/ho`` -> ``'/home/``
- ``*args``/``**kwargs`` resolving. If possible Jedi replaces the parameters
  with the actual alternatives.
- Better support for enums/dataclasses
- When using Interpreter, properties are now executed, since a lot of people
  have complained about this. Discussion in #1299, #1347.

New APIs:

- ``Definition.get_signatures() -> List[Signature]``. Signatures are similar to
  ``CallSignature``. ``Definition.params`` is therefore deprecated.
- ``Signature.to_string()`` to format signatures.
- ``Signature.params -> List[ParamDefinition]``, ParamDefinition has the
  following additional attributes ``infer_default()``, ``infer_annotation()``,
  ``to_string()``, and ``kind``.
- ``Definition.execute() -> List[Definition]``, makes it possible to infer
  return values of functions.


0.14.1 (2019-07-13)
+++++++++++++++++++

- CallSignature.index should now be working a lot better
- A couple of smaller bugfixes

0.14.0 (2019-06-20)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Added ``goto_*(prefer_stubs=True)`` as well as ``goto_*(prefer_stubs=True)``
- Stubs are used now for type inference
- Typeshed is used for better type inference
- Reworked Definition.full_name, should have more correct return values

0.13.3 (2019-02-24)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed an issue with embedded Python, see https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim/issues/870

0.13.2 (2018-12-15)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed a bug that led to Jedi spawning a lot of subprocesses.

0.13.1 (2018-10-02)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Bugfixes, because tensorflow completions were still slow.

0.13.0 (2018-10-02)
+++++++++++++++++++

- A small release. Some bug fixes.
- Remove Python 3.3 support. Python 3.3 support has been dropped by the Python
  foundation.
- Default environments are now using the same Python version as the Python
  process. In 0.12.x, we used to load the latest Python version on the system.
- Added ``include_builtins`` as a parameter to usages.
- ``goto_assignments`` has a new ``follow_builtin_imports`` parameter that
  changes the previous behavior slightly.

0.12.1 (2018-06-30)
+++++++++++++++++++

- This release forces you to upgrade parso. If you don't, nothing will work
  anymore. Otherwise changes should be limited to bug fixes. Unfortunately Jedi
  still uses a few internals of parso that make it hard to keep compatibility
  over multiple releases. Parso >=0.3.0 is going to be needed.

0.12.0 (2018-04-15)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Virtualenv/Environment support
- F-String Completion/Goto Support
- Cannot crash with segfaults anymore
- Cleaned up import logic
- Understand async/await and autocomplete it (including async generators)
- Better namespace completions
- Passing tests for Windows (including CI for Windows)
- Remove Python 2.6 support

0.11.1 (2017-12-14)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Parso update - the caching layer was broken
- Better usages - a lot of internal code was ripped out and improved.

0.11.0 (2017-09-20)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Split Jedi's parser into a separate project called ``parso``.
- Avoiding side effects in REPL completion.
- Numpy docstring support should be much better.
- Moved the `settings.*recursion*` away, they are no longer usable.

0.10.2 (2017-04-05)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Python Packaging sucks. Some files were not included in 0.10.1.

0.10.1 (2017-04-05)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed a few very annoying bugs.
- Prepared the parser to be factored out of Jedi.

0.10.0 (2017-02-03)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Actual semantic completions for the complete Python syntax.
- Basic type inference for ``yield from`` PEP 380.
- PEP 484 support (most of the important features of it). Thanks Claude! (@reinhrst)
- Added ``get_line_code`` to ``Definition`` and ``Completion`` objects.
- Completely rewritten the type inference engine.
- A new and better parser for (fast) parsing diffs of Python code.

0.9.0 (2015-04-10)
++++++++++++++++++

- The import logic has been rewritten to look more like Python's. There is now
  an ``InferState.modules`` import cache, which resembles ``sys.modules``.
- Integrated the parser of 2to3. This will make refactoring possible. It will
  also be possible to check for error messages (like compiling an AST would give)
  in the future.
- With the new parser, the type inference also completely changed. It's now
  simpler and more readable.
- Completely rewritten REPL completion.
- Added ``jedi.names``, a command to do static analysis. Thanks to that
  sourcegraph guys for sponsoring this!
- Alpha version of the linter.


0.8.1 (2014-07-23)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Bugfix release, the last release forgot to include files that improve
  autocompletion for builtin libraries. Fixed.

0.8.0 (2014-05-05)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Memory Consumption for compiled modules (e.g. builtins, sys) has been reduced
  drastically. Loading times are down as well (it takes basically as long as an
  import).
- REPL completion is starting to become usable.
- Various small API changes. Generally this release focuses on stability and
  refactoring of internal APIs.
- Introducing operator precedence, which makes calculating correct Array
  indices and ``__getattr__`` strings possible.

0.7.0 (2013-08-09)
++++++++++++++++++

- Switched from LGPL to MIT license.
- Added an Interpreter class to the API to make autocompletion in REPL
  possible.
- Added autocompletion support for namespace packages.
- Add sith.py, a new random testing method.

0.6.0 (2013-05-14)
++++++++++++++++++

- Much faster parser with builtin part caching.
- A test suite, thanks @tkf.

0.5 versions (2012)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Initial development.
