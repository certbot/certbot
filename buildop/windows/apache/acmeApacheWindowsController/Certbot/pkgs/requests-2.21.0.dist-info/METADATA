Requests is the only *Non-GMO* HTTP library for Python, safe for human
consumption.

Behold, the power of Requests:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
>>> r.status_code
200
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'application/json; charset=utf8'
>>> r.encoding
'utf-8'
>>> r.text
u'{"type":"User"...'
>>> r.json()
{u'disk_usage': 368627, u'private_gists': 484, ...}
```

See [the similar code, sans Requests](https://gist.github.com/973705).

Requests allows you to send *organic, grass-fed* HTTP/1.1 requests,
without the need for manual labor. There's no need to manually add query
strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and
HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, thanks to
[urllib3](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3).

Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. Requests is one of the most
downloaded Python packages of all time, pulling in over 11,000,000
downloads every month. You don't want to be left out!

How to Contribute
-----------------

1.  Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion
    around a feature idea or a bug. There is a [Contributor
    Friendly](https://github.com/requests/requests/issues?direction=desc&labels=Contributor+Friendly&page=1&sort=updated&state=open)
    tag for issues that should be ideal for people who are not very
    familiar with the codebase yet.
2.  Fork [the repository](https://github.com/requests/requests) on
    GitHub to start making your changes to the **master** branch (or
    branch off of it).
3.  Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature
    works as expected.
4.  Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and
    published. :) Make sure to add yourself to
    [AUTHORS](https://github.com/requests/requests/blob/master/AUTHORS.rst).
