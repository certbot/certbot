This directory holds Apache 2.0 module-specific configuration files;
any files in this directory which have the ".conf" extension will be
processed as Apache configuration files.

Files are processed in alphabetical order, so if using configuration
directives which depend on, say, mod_perl being loaded, ensure that
these are placed in a filename later in the sort order than "perl.conf".
