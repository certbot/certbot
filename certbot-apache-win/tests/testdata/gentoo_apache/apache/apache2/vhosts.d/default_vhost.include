# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be
# e-mailed.  This address appears on some server-generated pages, such
# as error documents.  e.g. admin@your-domain.com
ServerAdmin root@localhost

# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.
#
# If you change this to something that isn't under /var/www then suexec
# will no longer work.
DocumentRoot "/var/www/localhost/htdocs"

# This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.

	# Possible values for the Options directive are "None", "All",
	# or any combination of:
	#   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews

	# Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
	# doesn't give it to you.

	# The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see
	# http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#options

	# AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.
	# It can be "All", "None", or any combination of the keywords:
	#   Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
	AllowOverride All

	# Controls who can get stuff from this server.

	# Redirect: Allows you to tell clients about documents that used to
	# exist in your server's namespace, but do not anymore. The client
	# will make a new request for the document at its new location.
	# Example:
	#   Redirect permanent /foo http://www.example.com/bar

	# Alias: Maps web paths into filesystem paths and is used to
	# access content that does not live under the DocumentRoot.
	# Example:
	#   Alias /webpath /full/filesystem/path
	#
	# If you include a trailing / on /webpath then the server will
	# require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely
	# need to provide a <Directory> section to allow access to
	# the filesystem path.

	# ScriptAlias: This controls which directories contain server scripts.
	# ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that
	# documents in the target directory are treated as applications and
	# run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the
	# client.  The same rules about trailing "/" apply to ScriptAlias
	# directives as to Alias.
	ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/var/www/localhost/cgi-bin/"

# "/var/www/localhost/cgi-bin" should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased
# CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.
