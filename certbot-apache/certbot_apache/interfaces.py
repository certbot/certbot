"""ParserNode interface for interacting with configuration tree.

General description
-------------------

The ParserNode interfaces are designed to be able to contain all the parsing logic,
while allowing their users to interact with the configuration tree in a Pythonic
and well structured manner.

The structure allows easy traversal of the tree of ParserNodes. Each ParserNode
stores a reference to its ancestor and immediate children, allowing the user to
traverse the tree using built in interface methods as well as accessing the interface
properties directly.

ParserNode interface implementation should stand between the actual underlying
parser functionality and the business logic within Configurator code, interfacing
with both. The ParserNode tree is a result of configuration parsing action.

ParserNode tree will be in charge of maintaining the parser state and hence the
abstract syntax tree (AST). Interactions between ParserNode tree and underlying
parser should involve only parsing the configuration files to this structure, and
writing it back to the filesystem - while preserving the format including whitespaces.

For some implementations (Apache for example) it's important to keep track of and
to use state information while parsing conditional blocks and directives. This
allows the implementation to set a flag to parts of the parsed configuration
structure as not being in effect in a case of unmatched conditional block. It's
important to store these blocks in the tree as well in order to not to conduct
destructive actions (failing to write back parts of the configuration) while writing
the AST back to the filesystem.

The ParserNode tree is in charge of maintaining the its own structure while every
child node fetched with find - methods or by iterating its list of children can be
changed in place. When making changes the affected nodes should be flagged as "dirty"
in order for the parser implementation to figure out the parts of the configuration
that need to be written back to disk during the save() operation.


Metadata
--------

The metadata holds all the implementation specific attributes of the ParserNodes -
things like the positional information related to the AST, file paths, whitespacing,
and any other information relevant to the underlying parser engine.

Access to the metadata should be handled by implementation specific methods, allowing
the Configurator functionality to access the underlying information where needed.
A good example of this is file path of a node - something that is needed by the
reverter functionality within the Configurator.


Apache implementation
---------------------

The Apache implementation of ParserNode interface requires some implementation
specific functionalities that are not described by the interface itself.

Conditional blocks

Apache configuration can have conditional blocks, for example: <IfModule ...>,
resulting the directives and subblocks within it being either enabled or disabled.
While find_* interface methods allow including the disabled parts of the configuration
tree in searches a special care needs to be taken while parsing the structure in
order to reflect the active state of configuration.

Whitespaces

Each ParserNode object is responsible of storing its prepending whitespace characters
in order to be able to write the AST back to filesystem like it was, preserving the
format, this applies for parameters of BlockNode and DirectiveNode as well.
When parameters of ParserNode are changed, the pre-existing whitespaces in the
parameter sequence are discarded, as the general reason for storing them is to
maintain the ability to write the configuration back to filesystem exactly like
it was. This loses its meaning when we have to change the directives or blocks
parameters for other reasons.

Searches and matching

Apache configuration is largely case insensitive, so the Apache implementation of
ParserNode interface needs to provide the user means to match block and directive
names and parameters in case insensitive manner. This does not apply to everything
however, for example the parameters of a conditional statement may be case sensitive.
For this reason the internal representation of data should not ignore the case.

    ParserNode is the basic building block of the tree of such nodes,
    representing the structure of the configuration. It is largely meant to keep
    the structure information intact and idiomatically accessible.

    The root node as well as the child nodes of it should be instances of ParserNode.
    Nodes keep track of their differences to on-disk representation of configuration
    by marking modified ParserNodes as dirty to enable partial write-to-disk for
    different files in the configuration structure.

    While for the most parts the usage and the child types are obvious, "include"-
    and similar directives are an exception to this rule. This is because of the
    nature of include directives - which unroll the contents of another file or
    configuration block to their place. While we could unroll the included nodes
    to the parent tree, it remains important to keep the context of include nodes
    separate in order to write back the original configuration as it was.

    For parsers that require the implementation to keep track of the whitespacing,
    it's responsibility of each ParserNode object itself to store its prepending
    whitespaces in order to be able to reconstruct the complete configuration file
    as it was when originally read from the disk.
