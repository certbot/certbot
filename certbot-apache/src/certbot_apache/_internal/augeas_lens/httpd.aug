About: Lens Usage
  Sample usage of this lens in augtool

  Apache configuration is represented by two main structures, nested sections
  and directives. Sections are used as labels, while directives are kept as a
  value. Sections and directives can have positional arguments inside values
  of "arg" nodes. Arguments of sections must be the firsts child of the
  section node.

  This lens doesn't support automatic string quoting. Hence, the string must
  be quoted when containing a space.

  Create a new VirtualHost section with one directive:
  > clear /files/etc/apache2/sites-available/foo/VirtualHost
  > set /files/etc/apache2/sites-available/foo/VirtualHost/arg "172.16.0.1:80"
  > set /files/etc/apache2/sites-available/foo/VirtualHost/directive "ServerAdmin"
  > set /files/etc/apache2/sites-available/foo/VirtualHost/*[self::directive="ServerAdmin"]/arg "admin@example.com"

About: Configuration files
  This lens applies to files in /etc/httpd and /etc/apache2. See <filter>.

(* The arguments for a directive come in two flavors: quoted with single or
