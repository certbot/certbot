# Virtual Hosts
#
# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

<IfDefine DEFAULT_VHOST>
# see bug #178966 why this is in here

# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, instead of the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
# directive.
#
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.
#
#Listen 12.34.56.78:80
Listen 80

# When virtual hosts are enabled, the main host defined in the default
# httpd.conf configuration will go away. We redefine it here so that it is
# still available.
#
# If you disable this vhost by removing -D DEFAULT_VHOST from
# /etc/conf.d/apache2, the first defined virtual host elsewhere will be
# the default.
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName localhost
	Include /etc/apache2/vhosts.d/default_vhost.include

	<IfModule mpm_peruser_module>
		ServerEnvironment apache apache
	</IfModule>
</VirtualHost>
