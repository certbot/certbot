# This configuration file reflects default settings for Apache HTTP Server.
# You may change these, but chances are that you may not need to.

# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
Timeout 300

# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.
KeepAlive On

# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100

# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the
# same client on the same connection.
KeepAliveTimeout 15

# UseCanonicalName: Determines how Apache constructs self-referencing
# URLs and the SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT variables.
# When set "Off", Apache will use the Hostname and Port supplied
# by the client.  When set "On", Apache will use the value of the
# ServerName directive.
UseCanonicalName Off

# AccessFileName: The name of the file to look for in each directory
# for additional configuration directives.  See also the AllowOverride
# directive.
AccessFileName .htaccess

# ServerTokens
# This directive configures what you return as the Server HTTP response
# Header. The default is 'Full' which sends information about the OS-Type
# and compiled in modules.
# Set to one of:  Full | OS | Minor | Minimal | Major | Prod
# where Full conveys the most information, and Prod the least.
ServerTokens Prod

# TraceEnable
# This directive overrides the behavior of TRACE for both the core server and
# mod_proxy. The default TraceEnable on permits TRACE requests per RFC 2616,
# which disallows any request body to accompany the request. TraceEnable off
# causes the core server and mod_proxy to return a 405 (Method not allowed)
# error to the client.
# For security reasons this is turned off by default. (bug #240680)
TraceEnable off

# Optionally add a line containing the server version and virtual host
# name to server-generated pages (internal error documents, FTP directory
# listings, mod_status and mod_info output etc., but not CGI generated
# documents or custom error documents).
# Set to "EMail" to also include a mailto: link to the ServerAdmin.
# Set to one of:  On | Off | EMail
ServerSignature On

# HostnameLookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
# e.g., www.apache.org (on) or 204.62.129.132 (off).
# The default is off because it'd be overall better for the net if people
# had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it means that
# each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup request to the
# nameserver.
HostnameLookups Off

# EnableMMAP and EnableSendfile: On systems that support it,
# memory-mapping or the sendfile syscall is used to deliver
# files.  This usually improves server performance, but must
# be turned off when serving from networked-mounted 
# filesystems or if support for these functions is otherwise
# broken on your system.
EnableMMAP On
EnableSendfile Off

# FileETag: Configures the file attributes that are used to create
# the ETag (entity tag) response header field when the document is
# based on a static file. (The ETag value is used in cache management
# to save network bandwidth.)
FileETag MTime Size

# ContentDigest: This directive enables the generation of Content-MD5
# headers as defined in RFC1864 respectively RFC2616.
# The Content-MD5 header provides an end-to-end message integrity
# check (MIC) of the entity-body. A proxy or client may check this
# header for detecting accidental modification of the entity-body
# in transit.
# Note that this can cause performance problems on your server since
# the message digest is computed on every request (the values are
# not cached).
# Content-MD5 is only sent for documents served by the core, and not
# by any module. For example, SSI documents, output from CGI scripts,
# and byte range responses do not have this header.
ContentDigest Off

# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
# If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a <VirtualHost>
# container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be
# logged here.  If you *do* define an error logfile for a <VirtualHost>
# container, that host's errors will be logged there and not here.
ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error_log

# LogLevel: Control the number of messages logged to the error_log.
# Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
# alert, emerg.
LogLevel warn

# We configure the "default" to be a very restrictive set of features.
