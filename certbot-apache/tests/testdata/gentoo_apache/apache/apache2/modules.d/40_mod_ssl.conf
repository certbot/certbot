<IfDefine SSL>
# This is the Apache server configuration file providing SSL support.
# It contains the configuration directives to instruct the server how to
# serve pages over an https connection. For detailing information about these 
# directives see <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html>

# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders. If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.

## Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG):
# Configure one or more sources to seed the PRNG of the SSL library.
# The seed data should be of good random quality.
# WARNING! On some platforms /dev/random blocks if not enough entropy
# is available. This means you then cannot use the /dev/random device
# because it would lead to very long connection times (as long as
# it requires to make more entropy available). But usually those
# platforms additionally provide a /dev/urandom device which doesn't
# block. So, if available, use this one instead. Read the mod_ssl User
# Manual for more details.
#SSLRandomSeed startup file:/dev/random  512
#SSLRandomSeed startup file:/dev/urandom 512
#SSLRandomSeed connect file:/dev/random  512

## SSL Global Context:
# All SSL configuration in this context applies both to the main server and 
# all SSL-enabled virtual hosts.

# Some MIME-types for downloading Certificates and CRLs
<IfModule mime_module>
	AddType application/x-x509-ca-cert .crt
	AddType application/x-pkcs7-crl    .crl
</IfModule>

## Pass Phrase Dialog:
# Configure the pass phrase gathering process. The filtering dialog program 
# (`builtin' is an internal terminal dialog) has to provide the pass phrase on
# stdout.
SSLPassPhraseDialog  builtin

## Inter-Process Session Cache:
# Configure the SSL Session Cache: First the mechanism  to use and second the
# expiring timeout (in seconds).
#SSLSessionCache		dbm:/run/ssl_scache
SSLSessionCache			shmcb:/run/ssl_scache(512000)

## Semaphore:
# Configure the path to the mutual exclusion semaphore the SSL engine uses
# internally for inter-process synchronization.
Mutex file:/run/apache_ssl_mutex ssl-cache

## SSL Compression:
# Known to be vulnerable thus disabled by default (bug #507324).
