# Note: Configurations that use IPv6 but not IPv4-mapped addresses need two
# Listen directives: "Listen [::]:443" and "Listen 0.0.0.0:443"

	## SSL Engine Switch:
	# Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.
	SSLEngine on

	## SSLProtocol:
	# Don't use SSLv2 anymore as it's considered to be broken security-wise.
	# Also disable SSLv3 as most modern browsers are capable of TLS.
	SSLProtocol ALL -SSLv2 -SSLv3

	## SSL Cipher Suite:
	# List the ciphers that the client is permitted to negotiate.
	# See the mod_ssl documentation for a complete list.
	# This list of ciphers is recommended by mozilla and was stripped off
	# its RC4 ciphers. (bug #506924)
	SSLCipherSuite ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-DSS-AES128-GCM-SHA256:kEDH+AESGCM:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128:AES256:HIGH:!RC4:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK

	## SSLHonorCipherOrder:
	# Prefer the server's cipher preference order as the client may have a
	# weak default order.
	SSLHonorCipherOrder On

	## Server Certificate:
	# Point SSLCertificateFile at a PEM encoded certificate. If the certificate
	# is encrypted, then you will be prompted for a pass phrase. Note that a 
	# kill -HUP will prompt again. Keep in mind that if you have both an RSA
	# and a DSA certificate you can configure both in parallel (to also allow
	# the use of DSA ciphers, etc.)
	SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/apache2/server.crt

	## Server Private Key:
	# If the key is not combined with the certificate, use this directive to
	# point at the key file. Keep in mind that if you've both a RSA and a DSA
	# private key you can configure both in parallel (to also allow the use of
	# DSA ciphers, etc.)
	SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/apache2/server.key

	## Server Certificate Chain:
	# Point SSLCertificateChainFile at a file containing the concatenation of 
	# PEM encoded CA certificates which form the certificate chain for the
	# server certificate. Alternatively the referenced file can be the same as
	# SSLCertificateFile when the CA certificates are directly appended to the
	# server certificate for convenience.
	#SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/apache2/ca.crt

	## Certificate Authority (CA):
	# Set the CA certificate verification path where to find CA certificates
	# for client authentication or alternatively one huge file containing all
	# of them (file must be PEM encoded).
	# Note: Inside SSLCACertificatePath you need hash symlinks to point to the
	# certificate files. Use the provided Makefile to update the hash symlinks
	# after changes.
	#SSLCACertificatePath /etc/ssl/apache2/ssl.crt
	#SSLCACertificateFile /etc/ssl/apache2/ca-bundle.crt

	## Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL):
	# Set the CA revocation path where to find CA CRLs for client authentication
	# or alternatively one huge file containing all of them (file must be PEM 
	# encoded).
	# Note: Inside SSLCARevocationPath you need hash symlinks to point to the
	# certificate files. Use the provided Makefile to update the hash symlinks
	# after changes.
	#SSLCARevocationPath /etc/ssl/apache2/ssl.crl
	#SSLCARevocationFile /etc/ssl/apache2/ca-bundle.crl

	## Client Authentication (Type):
	# Client certificate verification type and depth. Types are none, optional,
	# require and optional_no_ca. Depth is a number which specifies how deeply
	# to verify the certificate issuer chain before deciding the certificate is
	# not valid.
	#SSLVerifyClient require
	#SSLVerifyDepth  10

	## Access Control:
	# With SSLRequire you can do per-directory access control based on arbitrary
	# complex boolean expressions containing server variable checks and other
	# lookup directives. The syntax is a mixture between C and Perl. See the
	# mod_ssl documentation for more details.
	#<Location />
	#	#SSLRequire (    %{SSL_CIPHER} !~ m/^(EXP|NULL)/ \
	#	and %{SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_O} eq "Snake Oil, Ltd." \
	#	and %{SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_OU} in {"Staff", "CA", "Dev"} \
	#	and %{TIME_WDAY} >= 1 and %{TIME_WDAY} <= 5 \
	#	and %{TIME_HOUR} >= 8 and %{TIME_HOUR} <= 20       ) \
	#	or %{REMOTE_ADDR} =~ m/^192\.76\.162\.[0-9]+$/
	#</Location>

	## SSL Engine Options:
	# Set various options for the SSL engine.

	## FakeBasicAuth:
	# Translate the client X.509 into a Basic Authorisation. This means that the
	# standard Auth/DBMAuth methods can be used for access control. The user 
	# name is the `one line' version of the client's X.509 certificate. 
	# Note that no password is obtained from the user. Every entry in the user 
	# file needs this password: `xxj31ZMTZzkVA'.

	## ExportCertData:
	# This exports two additional environment variables: SSL_CLIENT_CERT and 
	# SSL_SERVER_CERT. These contain the PEM-encoded certificates of the server
	# (always existing) and the client (only existing when client 
	# authentication is used). This can be used to import the certificates into
	# CGI scripts.

	## StdEnvVars:
	# This exports the standard SSL/TLS related `SSL_*' environment variables. 
	# Per default this exportation is switched off for performance reasons, 
	# because the extraction step is an expensive operation and is usually 
	# useless for serving static content. So one usually enables the exportation
	# for CGI and SSI requests only.

	## StrictRequire:
	# This denies access when "SSLRequireSSL" or "SSLRequire" applied even under
	# a "Satisfy any" situation, i.e. when it applies access is denied and no
	# other module can change it.

	## OptRenegotiate:
	# This enables optimized SSL connection renegotiation handling when SSL 
	# directives are used in per-directory context.
	#SSLOptions +FakeBasicAuth +ExportCertData +StrictRequire

	## SSL Protocol Adjustments:
	# The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
	# approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait
	# for the close notify alert from client. When you need a different
	# shutdown approach you can use one of the following variables:

	## ssl-unclean-shutdown:
	# This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
	# SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates the
	# SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use this when
	# you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where mod_ssl
	# sends the close notify alert.

	## ssl-accurate-shutdown:
	# This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
	# SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
	# alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
	# practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
	# this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation works
	# correctly. 
	# Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP 
	# keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable 
	# keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
	# Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
	# their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
	# "force-response-1.0" for this.
	<IfModule setenvif_module>
		BrowserMatch ".*MSIE.*" \
			nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
			downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0

	## Per-Server Logging:
	# The home of a custom SSL log file. Use this when you want a compact 
	# non-error SSL logfile on a virtual host basis.
	<IfModule log_config_module>
		CustomLog /var/log/apache2/ssl_request_log \
			"%t %h %{SSL_PROTOCOL}x %{SSL_CIPHER}x \"%r\" %b"
