This directory contains your keys and certificates.

`privkey.pem`  : the private key for your certificate.
`fullchain.pem`: the certificate file used in most server software.
`chain.pem`    : used for OCSP stapling in Nginx >=1.3.7.
`cert.pem`     : will break many server configurations, and should not be used
                 without reading further documentation (see link below).

We recommend not moving these files. For more information, see the Certbot
User Guide at https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#where-are-my-certificates.
