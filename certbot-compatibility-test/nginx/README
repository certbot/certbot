Eventually there will also be a compatibility test here like the Apache one.

Right now, this is data for the roundtrip test (checking that the parser
can parse each file and that the reserialized config file it generates is
identical to the original).

If run in a virtualenv or otherwise so that certbot can be imported,
the roundtrip test can run as

python roundtrip.py nginx-roundtrip-testdata

It gives exit status 0 for success and 1 if at least one parse or roundtrip
failure occurred.


The directory nginx-roundtrip-testdata includes some config files that were
contributed to our project as well as most of the configs linked from

Some exceptions that were skipped are

https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/SSL-Offloader/ (not much nginx configuration)
https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/xsendfile/ (likewise)
