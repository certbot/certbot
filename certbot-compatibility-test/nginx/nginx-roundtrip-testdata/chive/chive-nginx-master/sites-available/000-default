### Block all illegal host headers. Taken from a discussion on nginx
### forums. Cf. http://forum.nginx.org/read.php?2,3482,3518 following
### a suggestion by Maxim Dounin. Also suggested in
### http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/request_processing.html.
server {
    listen [::]:80 default_server;
    # Uncomment the line below and comment the above if you're
    # running a Nginx version less than 0.8.20.
    # listen [::]:80 default;

    # Accept redirects based on the value of the Host header. If
    # there's no valid vhost configuration file with a
    # corresponding server_name directive then signal an error and
    # fail silently. See:
