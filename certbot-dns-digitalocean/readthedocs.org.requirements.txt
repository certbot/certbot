# readthedocs.org gives no way to change the install command to "pip
# install -e certbot-dns-digitalocean[docs]" (that would in turn install documentation
# dependencies), but it allows to specify a requirements.txt file at
# https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/letsencrypt/advanced/ (c.f. #259)

# Although ReadTheDocs certainly doesn't need to install the project
# in --editable mode (-e), just "pip install certbot-dns-digitalocean[docs]" does not work as
# expected and "pip install -e certbot-dns-digitalocean[docs]" must be used instead

# We also pin our dependencies for increased stability.
