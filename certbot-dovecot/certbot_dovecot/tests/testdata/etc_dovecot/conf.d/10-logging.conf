# no, plain and sha1. sha1 can be useful for detecting brute force password
# attempts vs. user simply trying the same password over and over again.

# string.

# Login log format. %s contains login_log_format_elements string, %$ contains
# the data we want to log.

# Log prefix for mail processes. See doc/wiki/Variables.txt for list of
# possible variables you can use.

# Format to use for logging mail deliveries. See doc/wiki/Variables.txt for
# list of all variables you can use. Some of the common ones include:
#  %$ - Delivery status message (e.g. "saved to INBOX")
#  %m - Message-ID
#  %s - Subject
#  %f - From address
#  %p - Physical size
#  %w - Virtual size
#deliver_log_format = msgid=%m: %$
