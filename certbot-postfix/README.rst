==========================
Postfix plugin for Certbot
==========================

To install your certs with this plugin, run:

``certbot install --installer postfix --cert-path <path to cert> --key-path <path to key> -d <MX hostname>``

And there you go! If you'd like to obtain these certificates via certbot, there's more documentation on how to do this `here <https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#getting-certificates-and-choosing-plugins>`_.
