The following command has been used to generate test keys:

	for x in 256 512 2048; do openssl genrsa -out rsa${k}_key.pem $k; done

For the elliptic curve private keys, this command was used:

	for k in "prime256v1" "secp384r1" "secp521r1" do
	    openssl genpkey -algorithm ${k} -out ec_${k}_key.pem
    done

and for the CSR PEM (Certificate Signing Request):

		openssl req -new -out csr-Xsans_X.pem -key rsa512_key.pem [-config csr-Xsans_X.conf | -subj '/CN=example.com'] [-outform DER > csr_X.der]

and for the certificate:

  openssl req -new -out cert_X.pem -key rsaX_key.pem -subj '/CN=example.com' -x509 [-outform DER > cert_X.der]
