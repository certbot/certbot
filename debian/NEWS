letsencrypt (0.0.20150826-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  This code is a DEVELOPER PREVIEW, running from an arbitrary
  git revision.  DO NOT RUN THIS CODE ON A PRODUCTION SERVER.
  It will install certificates that are signed by a test CA,
  and may do anything from causing warnings for your users
  to making your website utterly inaccessible for your HSTS or
  HPKP covered URL.
