Get Started
=====================

Setting up a secure website with Certbot is easy. The steps are: 

#. Install Certbot
#. Get a certificate
#. Install the certificate on your web server.

The easiest instructions for these three steps are in the `interactive installation guide <https://certbot.eff.org>`_. Unless you have special circumstances, go there first. If you are not sure what a certificate is, see :ref:`what`. For more advanced topics, see the :ref:`using`.
