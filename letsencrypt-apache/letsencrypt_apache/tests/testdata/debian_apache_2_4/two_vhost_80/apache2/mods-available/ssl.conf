	# Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG):
	# Configure one or more sources to seed the PRNG of the SSL library.
	# The seed data should be of good random quality.
	# WARNING! On some platforms /dev/random blocks if not enough entropy
	# is available. This means you then cannot use the /dev/random device
	# because it would lead to very long connection times (as long as
	# it requires to make more entropy available). But usually those
	# platforms additionally provide a /dev/urandom device which doesn't
	# block. So, if available, use this one instead. Read the mod_ssl User
	# Manual for more details.

	#   SSL Cipher Suite:
	#   List the ciphers that the client is permitted to negotiate. See the
	#   ciphers(1) man page from the openssl package for list of all available
	#   options.
	#   Enable only secure ciphers:
	SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!aNULL:!MD5

	#   Speed-optimized SSL Cipher configuration:
	#   If speed is your main concern (on busy HTTPS servers e.g.),
	#   you might want to force clients to specific, performance
	#   optimized ciphers. In this case, prepend those ciphers
	#   to the SSLCipherSuite list, and enable SSLHonorCipherOrder.
	#   Caveat: by giving precedence to RC4-SHA and AES128-SHA
	#   (as in the example below), most connections will no longer
	#   have perfect forward secrecy - if the server's key is
	#   compromised, captures of past or future traffic must be
	#   considered compromised, too.
