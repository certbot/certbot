Catches and ignores errors during the directory fetch for ARI checking so that these errors do not hinder the actual certificate issuance. Certbot also now uses the server value from the renewal configuration file for ARI checks instead of the server value from the current invocation of Certbot. This helps prevent ARI requests from going to the wrong server if the user changes CAs.
