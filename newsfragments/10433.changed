A few largely unused functions/types have been deprecated in our effort to remove our OpenSSL dependency:
    * Deprecated: `certbot.crypto_util.get_sans_from_cert`
    * Deprecated: `certbot.crypto_util.get_names_from_cert`
    * Deprecated: `certbot.crypto_util.get_names_from_req`
    * Deprecated: `acme.crypto_util.Format`
Additionally, `certbot.crypto_util.import_csr_file` will soon only return the CSR object in PEM format. Previously, it would also return a list of domains and the filetype (which was hardcoded to PEM anyway)
