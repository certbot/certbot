Moved nearly all code for the certbot-nginx and certbot-apache plugins into private modules in the certbot package which now offers "apache" and "nginx" [extras](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/#extras). Users should notice no major changes. certbot-apache and certbot-nginx will continue to exist as simple packages that depend on certbot and also help register the plugin with certbot so it knows the functionality is available.
