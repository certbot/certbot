# Warnings being triggered by our plugins using deprecated features in
# acme/certbot should be fixed by having our plugins no longer using the
# deprecated code rather than adding them to the list of ignored warnings here.
# Fixing things in this way prevents us from shipping packages raising our own
# deprecation warnings and gives time for plugins that don't use the deprecated
# API to propagate, especially for plugins packaged as an external snap, before
# we release breaking changes.
#
# The current warnings being ignored are:
# 1) The warning raised when importing certbot.tests.util and the external mock
#    library is installed.
# 2) An ImportWarning is raised with older versions of setuptools and
#    zope.interface. See
#    https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/68 for more info.
# 3) The deprecation warning raised when importing old Zope interfaces from
#    the certbot.interfaces module.
# 4) The deprecation warning raised when importing deprecated attributes from
#    the certbot.display.util module.
# 5) A deprecation warning is raised in dnspython==1.15.0 in the oldest tests for
#    certbot-dns-rfc2136.
# 6) The vendored version of six in botocore causes ImportWarnings in Python
#    3.10+. See https://github.com/boto/botocore/issues/2548.
# 7) botocore's default TLS settings raise deprecation warnings in Python
#    3.10+, but their values are sane from a security perspective. See
#    https://github.com/boto/botocore/issues/2550.
