# In general, all warnings are treated as errors. Here are the exceptions:
#   1- decodestring: https://github.com/rthalley/dnspython/issues/338
#   2- Python 2 deprecation: https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/8388
#      (to be removed with Certbot 1.12.0 and its drop of Python 2 support)
# Warnings being triggered by our plugins using deprecated features in
# acme/certbot should be fixed by having our plugins no longer using the
# deprecated code rather than adding them to the list of ignored warnings here.
# Fixing things in this way prevents us from shipping packages raising our own
# deprecation warnings and gives time for plugins that don't use the deprecated
# API to propagate, especially for plugins packaged as an external snap, before
# we release breaking changes.
