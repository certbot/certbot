# In general, all warnings are treated as errors. Here are the exceptions:
#   1- decodestring: https://github.com/rthalley/dnspython/issues/338
#   2- ignore warn for importing abstract classes from collections instead of collections.abc,
#      too much third party dependencies are still relying on this behavior,
#      but it should be corrected to allow Certbot compatibility with Python >= 3.8
