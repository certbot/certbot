# Warnings being triggered by our plugins using deprecated features in
# acme/certbot should be fixed by having our plugins no longer using the
# deprecated code rather than adding them to the list of ignored warnings here.
# Fixing things in this way prevents us from shipping packages raising our own
# deprecation warnings and gives time for plugins that don't use the deprecated
# API to propagate, especially for plugins packaged as an external snap, before
# we release breaking changes.
#
# The current warnings being ignored are:
# 1) A deprecation warning is raised in dnspython==1.15.0 in the oldest tests for
#    certbot-dns-rfc2136.
# 2) botocore's default TLS settings raise deprecation warnings in Python
#    3.10+, but their values are sane from a security perspective. See
#    https://github.com/boto/botocore/issues/2550.
# 3) pytest-cov uses deprecated functionality in pytest-xdist, to be resolved by
#    https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/557.
