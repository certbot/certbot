# Warnings being triggered by our plugins using deprecated features in
# acme/certbot should be fixed by having our plugins no longer using the
# deprecated code rather than adding them to the list of ignored warnings here.
# Fixing things in this way prevents us from shipping packages raising our own
# deprecation warnings and gives time for plugins that don't use the deprecated
# API to propagate, especially for plugins packaged as an external snap, before
# we release breaking changes.
#
# The current warnings being ignored are:
# 1) A deprecation warning is raised in dnspython==1.15.0 in the oldest tests for
#    certbot-dns-rfc2136.
# 2) pytest-cov uses deprecated functionality in pytest-xdist, to be resolved by
#    https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/557.
# 3) requests-toolbelt<0.10.1 can cause this warning to be raised during our
#    unit tests. This warning should be ignored until our (transitive)
#    dependency on requests-toolbelt is removed or our pinned version can be
#    updated.
# 4) Ignore our own PendingDeprecationWarning about update_symlinks soon to be dropped.
#    See https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/6284.
# 5) Ignore pkg_resources.declare_namespace used a large number of Google's Python
#    libs. e.g. https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-python/issues/1229.
