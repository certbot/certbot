# Warnings being triggered by our plugins using deprecated features in
# acme/certbot should be fixed by having our plugins no longer using the
# deprecated code rather than adding them to the list of ignored warnings here.
# Fixing things in this way prevents us from shipping packages raising our own
# deprecation warnings and gives time for plugins that don't use the deprecated
# API to propagate, especially for plugins packaged as an external snap, before
# we release breaking changes.
#
# The current warnings being ignored are:
# 1) pytest-cov uses deprecated functionality in pytest-xdist, to be resolved by
#    https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/557.
# 2) requests-toolbelt<0.10.1 can cause this warning to be raised during our
#    unit tests. This warning should be ignored until our (transitive)
#    dependency on requests-toolbelt is removed or our pinned version can be
#    updated.
# 3) Ignore DeprecationWarning for datetime.utcfromtimestamp() triggered
#    from dateutil. See https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil/issues/1314.
# 4 & 5) The pyOpenSSL X509/PKey warnings are due to TLS-ALPN-01 support.
#        Resolving these warnings is being tracked by
#        https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/10079.
# 6 - 11) Planning to remove unused TLS-ALPN support in acme.
#         See https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/10266 and
#         https://github.com/certbot/certbot/pull/10294.
