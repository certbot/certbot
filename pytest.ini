# Warnings being triggered by our plugins using deprecated features in
# acme/certbot should be fixed by having our plugins no longer using the
# deprecated code rather than adding them to the list of ignored warnings here.
# Fixing things in this way prevents us from shipping packages raising our own
# deprecation warnings and gives time for plugins that don't use the deprecated
# API to propagate, especially for plugins packaged as an external snap, before
# we release breaking changes.
#
# The current warnings being ignored are:
# 1) A deprecation warning is raised in dnspython==1.15.0 in the oldest tests for
#    certbot-dns-rfc2136.
# 2) pytest-cov uses deprecated functionality in pytest-xdist, to be resolved by
#    https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/557.
# 3) requests-toolbelt<0.10.1 can cause this warning to be raised during our
#    unit tests. This warning should be ignored until our (transitive)
#    dependency on requests-toolbelt is removed or our pinned version can be
#    updated.
# 4) Ignore our own PendingDeprecationWarning about update_symlinks soon to be dropped.
#    See https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/6284.
# 5) Ignore pkg_resources.declare_namespace used in a large number of Google's Python
#    libs. e.g. https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-python/issues/1229.
#    It is also is used in sphinxcontrib-devhelp 1.0.2 which as of writing this
#    is the latest version of that library. See
#    https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinxcontrib-devhelp/blob/1.0.2/setup.py#L69.
# 6) Ignore DeprecationWarning from using pkg_resources API
# 7) Ignore our own PendingDeprecationWarning about Python 3.7 soon to be dropped.
# 8) Ignore DeprecationWarning for datetime.utcfromtimestamp() triggered
#    when importing the pytz.tzinfo module
#    https://github.com/stub42/pytz/issues/105
# 9) Boto3 is dropping support for Python 3.7 by end of 2023. Let's ignore the associated
#    deprecation warning since we will also drop Python 3.7 soon.
