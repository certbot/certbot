# In general, all warnings are treated as errors. Here are the exceptions:
#   1- decodestring: https://github.com/rthalley/dnspython/issues/338
#   2- ignore our own TLS-SNI-01 warning
#   3- ignore warn for importing abstract classes from collections instead of collections.abc,
#      too much third party dependencies are still relying on this behavior,
#      but it should be corrected to allow Certbot compatiblity with Python >= 3.8
#   4- ipdb uses deprecated functionality of IPython. See
#      https://github.com/gotcha/ipdb/issues/144.
