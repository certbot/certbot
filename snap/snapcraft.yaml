summary: Automatically configure HTTPS using Let's Encrypt
description: |
 The objective of Certbot, Let's Encrypt, and the ACME (Automated
 Certificate Management Environment) protocol is to make it possible
 to set up an HTTPS server and have it automatically obtain a
 browser-trusted certificate, without any human intervention. This is
 accomplished by running a certificate management agent on the web
 server.
 
 This agent is used to:
   - Automatically prove to the Let's Encrypt CA that you control the website
   - Obtain a browser-trusted certificate and set it up on your web server
   - Keep track of when your certificate is going to expire, and renew it
   - Help you revoke the certificate if that ever becomes necessary.
