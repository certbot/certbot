"""
Post-release script to publish artifacts created from Azure Pipelines.

This currently includes:

* Moving snaps from the candidate/beta channel to the stable channel
* Publishing the Windows installer in a GitHub release

Setup:
 - Install the snapcraft command line tool and log in to a privileged account.
   - https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapcraft
   - Use the command `snapcraft login` to log in.

Run:

python tools/finish_release.py --css <URL of code signing server>

Testing:

This script can be safely run between releases. When this is done, the script
should execute successfully until the final step when it tries to set draft
equal to false on the GitHub release. This step should fail because a published
release with that name already exists.
