"""
Post-release script to publish artifacts created from Azure Pipelines.

This currently includes:

* Moving snaps from the beta channel to the stable channel

Setup:
 - Install the snapcraft command line tool and log in to a privileged account.
   - https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapcraft
   - Use the command `snapcraft login` to log in.

Run:

python tools/finish_release.py

Testing:

This script can be safely run between releases. When this is done, the script
should execute successfully.
