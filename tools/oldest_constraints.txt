# This file contains the oldest versions of our dependencies we're trying to
# support. Usually these version numbers are taken from the packages of our
# dependencies available in popular LTS Linux distros. Keeping compatibility
# with those versions makes it much easier for OS maintainers to update their
# Certbot packages.
#
# When updating these dependencies, we should try to only update them to the
# oldest version of the package that is found in a non-EOL'd version of
# CentOS, Debian, or Ubuntu that has Certbot packages in their OS repositories
# using a version of Python we support. If the distro is EOL'd or using a
# version of Python we don't support, it can be ignored.

# CentOS/RHEL 7 EPEL constraints
# Some of these constraints may be stricter than necessary because they
# initially referred to the Python 2 packages in CentOS/RHEL 7 with EPEL.
