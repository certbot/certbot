# Extra dependencies
# As of writing this, cython is a build dependency of pyyaml. Since there
# doesn't appear to be a good way to automatically track down and pin build
# dependencies in Python (see
# https://discuss.python.org/t/how-to-pin-build-dependencies/8238), we list it
# as a dependency here to ensure a version of cython is pinned for extra
# stability.
#
# We also pin back cython as is currently required by pyyaml. See
# https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/pull/702 and
# https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/601.
cython = "<3.0"
# setuptools-rust is a build dependency of cryptography, and since we don't have
# a great way of pinning build dependencies, we simply list it here to ensure a
# working version. Note: if build dependencies of setuptools-rust break at some
# point, it's probably worth enumerating and pinning them (and recursing to
# THEIR build dependencies) as well.
setuptools-rust = "*"
# pylint often adds new checks that we need to conform our code to when
# upgrading our dependencies. To help control when this needs to be done, we
# pin pylint to a compatible version here.
#
# If this pinning is removed, we may still need to add a lower bound for the
# pylint version. See https://github.com/certbot/certbot/pull/9229.

# Bug in poetry, where still installes yanked versions from pypi (source: https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2453)

# Making sure that it would not get installed (Fixing https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/9336)

# Branch 4.x of tox introduces backward incompatibility changes, so require a newer
