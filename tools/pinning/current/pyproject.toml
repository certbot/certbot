# Extra dependencies
# awscli is just listed here as a performance optimization. As of writing this,
# there are some conflicts in shared dependencies between it and other packages
# we depend on. To try and resolve them, poetry searches through older versions
# of awscli to see if that resolves the conflict, but there are over 1000
# versions of awscli on PyPI so this process takes too long. Providing a high
# minimum version here prevents poetry from searching this path and it fairly
# quickly resolves the dependency conflict in another way.
awscli = ">=1.22.76"
# As of writing this, cython is a build dependency of pyyaml. Since there
# doesn't appear to be a good way to automatically track down and pin build
# dependencies in Python (see
# https://discuss.python.org/t/how-to-pin-build-dependencies/8238), we list it
# as a dependency here to ensure a version of cython is pinned for extra
# stability.
cython = "*"
# poetry 1.2.0+ is required for it to pin pip, setuptools, and wheel. See
# https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1584. This version is required
# here in addition to certbot/setup.py because otherwise the pre-release
# version of poetry will not be installed.
#
# Additionally, newer versions of poetry/poetry-core include package extras
# (e.g. "docker[ssh]") in its `poetry export` output which is valid for
# requirements files, but not constraints files. We are currently using that
# output as constraints so let's also pin back poetry and poetry-core until we
# have a better workaround.
poetry = "1.2.0a2"
poetry-core = "1.1.0a7"
# setuptools-rust is a build dependency of cryptography, and since we don't have
# a great way of pinning build dependencies, we simply list it here to ensure a
# working version. Note: if build dependencies of setuptools-rust break at some
# point, it's probably worth enumerating and pinning them (and recursing to
# THEIR build dependencies) as well.
setuptools-rust = "*"
# pylint often adds new checks that we need to conform our code to when
# upgrading our dependencies. To help control when this needs to be done, we
# pin pylint to a compatible version here.
#
# If this pinning is removed, we may still need to add a lower bound for the
# pylint version. See https://github.com/certbot/certbot/pull/9229.

# Bug in poetry, where still installes yanked versions from pypi (source: https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2453)
