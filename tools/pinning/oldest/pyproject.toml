# Oldest dependencies
# We specify the oldest versions of our dependencies that we keep
# support for below. We should only update these packages as needed to make use
# of features in newer versions of our dependencies. Keeping compatibility with
# older packages makes it much easier for OS maintainers to update their
# Certbot packages if needed or desired.
#
# When updating these dependencies, we should try to update them no further
# than the oldest version of the dependency found in CentOS/RHEL 8 + EPEL (or
# newer versions of CentOS/RHEL + EPEL) as our Certbot packages there see
# frequent updates. If the dependency being updated is a direct dependency of
# one of our own packages, the minimum required version of that dependency
# should be updated in our setup.py files as well to communicate this
# information to our users.
