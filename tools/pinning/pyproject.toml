# Extra dependencies
# awscli is just listed here as a performance optimization. As of writing this,
# there are some conflicts in shared dependencies between it and other packages
# we depend on. To try and resolve them, poetry searches through older versions
# of awscli to see if that resolves the conflict, but there are over 1000
# versions of awscli on PyPI so this process takes too long. Providing a high
# minimum version here prevents poetry from searching this path and it fairly
# quickly resolves the dependency conflict in another way.
awscli = ">=1.19.62"
# As of writing this, cython is a build dependency of pyyaml. Since there
# doesn't appear to be a good way to automatically track down and pin build
# dependencies in Python (see
# https://discuss.python.org/t/how-to-pin-build-dependencies/8238), we list it
# as a dependency here to ensure a version of cython is pinned for extra
# stability.
cython = "*"
# We install mock in our "external-mock" tox environment to test that we didn't
# break Certbot's test API which used to always use mock objects from the 3rd
# party mock library. We list the mock dependency here so that is pinned, but
# we don't depend on it in Certbot to avoid installing mock when it's not
# needed. This dependency can be removed here once Certbot's support for the
# 3rd party mock library has been dropped.
mock = "*"
# We were originally pinning back python-augeas for certbot-auto because we
# found the way older versions of the library linked to Augeas were more
# reliable. That's no longer a concern, however, we continue to pin back the
# library for now because it causes Certbot tests on Windows to fail. See
# https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/8732.
python-augeas = "0.5.0"
# Because some parts of Certbot documentation are generated from zope.interfaces,
# we need the Sphinx plugin repoze.sphinx.autointerface. This plugin is not
# currently compatible with Sphinx>=4 though so we're pinning an older version
# for now. See https://github.com/repoze/repoze.sphinx.autointerface/issues/16
# for more info. This pinning could also be removed by the removal of
# zope.interface in Certbot.

# Library traitlets is a transitive dependency of ipdb (traitlets -> ipython -> ipdb).
# Version 5.x is incompatible with Python 3.6 but for some reasons, poetry fails to
# add the appropriate marker and allows this version to be installed under Python 3.6.
# We add a pinning to not create a set of requirements incompatible with Python 3.6.
